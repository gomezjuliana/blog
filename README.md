### Questions
1. What do you think you would do different if you had 2 weeks to complete this assignment and no requirement to use Github. What would your backend solution look like?

I've focused heavily on learning frontend technologies so for the moment, I can't answer what I'd do differently on the backend. I would liked to learn different options for backend solutions, specifically when it's appropriate to use a different solution.

2. How and where do you feel like this application should be deployed to?

I would deploy this application on Heroku since it's quite small and there isn't any sensitive information contained in the code. I've deployed a few of my projects on Heroku using PHP servers and have had success doing so. That said, I understand that with larger projects there are other considerations to keep in mind. I'm eager to learn about this as I grow in my career.

3. Are you happy with your own solutions? If yes, what parts do you think are really well done, if not, what would you want to change?

I'm fairly happy with my solutions but I see room to grow as well. The forward and backward function was really tricky for me, I spent a fair chunk of mental energy on it. I've also started grabbing design inspiration from around the web instead of making it up on my own and I see an improvement in the look and feel of my applications already. I'd like to be able to work on the writer user stories and abstract a function to create elements similar to createButton so cut down on a few repetitive lines of code.
